# 42-Libft
*Your very first own library*

## Introduction
Introductory project to the 42 cursus. Recode of a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that will be used for other projects in the cursus.

## Outline
In this project you will create your own functions based on existing functions in the C standard library. It will be helpful to look up the specifics of a function in its manpage (eg. ```man atoi```). This project will help you learn about string manipulation and memory allocation, some of the functions may have been coded in the Piscine. Certain functions in Libft build on other functions.

## Function Overview
| Function | Description |
| :------: | :---------: |
| ``ft_atoi`` | Reads a String, and, after ignoring spaces with ``ft_isspace``, saves the string into an integer |
| ``ft_bzero`` |Â Writes ``n`` zeroes to the string ``s`` |
| ``ft_calloc`` | Reserves ``x`` blocks of ``y`` bits of memory
